Find the lowest cost way to transform a three or four letter word into another by changing one letter at a time so that all of the intervening strings are legal English words.  The cost of a replacement letter is one, its Scrabble tile value (e.g., e:1, k:5, q:10), or its IDF score.  Try transforming dog into cat.
